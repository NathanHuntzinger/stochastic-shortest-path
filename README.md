# Final Project

## Idea

## Predict the future price of a house + mortgage to figure out when to buy

You could use a monte carlo simulation to predict the future price of a house. You could also use a
monte carlo simulation to predict the future mortgage rate. You could then use these two monte carlo
simulations to predict the future price of a house + mortgage.

Then you use an optimal stopping problem to figure out when to buy the house.

This would implement two of the class algorithms, monte carlo simulation and optimal stopping.
